<p><lb n="070809"/>He closed his long thin lips an instant but, eager to be on, raised an

<div><head><lb n="070812"/>IMPROMPTU</head>

<p><lb n="070819"/>His gaze turned at once but slowly from J. J. O'Molloy's towards

<lb n="070822"/>seeking, he said:
<lb n="070823"/><said who="profmh">―When Fitzgibbon's speech had ended John F Taylor rose to reply. Briefly,
<lb n="070824"/>as well as I can bring them to mind, his words were these.</said></p>

<p><lb n="070860"/>A dumb belch of hunger cleft his speech. He lifted his voice above it

<p><lb n="070963"/>Mr Bloom, breathless, caught in a whirl of wild newsboys near the
<lb n="070964"/>offices of the <title type="newspaper">Irish Catholic</title> and <title type="newspaper">Dublin Penny Journal</title>, called:
<lb n="070965"/><said who="lb">―Mr Crawford! A moment!</said>
<lb n="070966"/><said who="uns">―<title type="newspaper">Telegraph</title>! Racing special!</said>
<lb n="070967"/><said who="myc">―What is it?</said> Myles Crawford said, falling back a pace.</p>
<p><lb n="070968"/>A newsboy cried in Mr Bloom's face:
<lb n="070969"/><said who="uns">―Terrible tragedy in Rathmines! A child bit by a bellows!</said></p></div>
<div><head><lb n="070970"/>INTERVIEW WITH THE EDITOR</head>
<p><lb n="070971"/><said who="lb">―Just this ad,</said> Mr Bloom said, pushing through towards the steps, puffing,
<lb n="070972"/>and taking the cutting from his pocket. <said who="lb">I spoke with Mr Keyes just now.
<lb n="070973"/>He'll give a renewal for two months, he says. After he'll see. But he wants a
<lb n="070974"/>par to call attention in the <title type="newspaper">Telegraph</title> too, the Saturday pink. And he wants
<lb n="070975"/>it copied if it's not too late I told councillor Nannetti from the <title type="newspaper">Kilkenny
<lb n="070976"/>People</title>. I can have access to it in the national library. House of keys, don't
<lb n="070977"/>you see? His name is Keyes. It's a play on the name. But he practically
<lb n="070978"/>promised he'd give the renewal. But he wants just a little puff. What will I
<lb n="070979"/>tell him, Mr Crawford?</said></p></div>

<p><lb n="070983"/><said who="lb" aloud="false">A bit nervy. Look out for squalls. All off for a drink. Arm in arm.

<lb n="070986"/>today. Last time I saw him he had his heels on view. Been walking in muck
<lb n="070987"/>somewhere. Careless chap. What was he doing in Irishtown?</said>
<lb n="070988"/><said who="lb">―Well,</said> Mr Bloom said, his eyes returning, <said who="lb">if I can get the design I suppose
<lb n="070989"/>it's worth a short par. He'd give the ad, I think. I'll tell him ...</said></p></div>

<lb n="070997"/>I've been through the hoop myself. I was looking for a fellow to back a bill
<lb n="070998"/>for me no later than last week. Sorry, Jack. You must take the will for the
<lb n="070999"/>deed. With a heart and a half if I could raise the wind anyhow.</said></p>
<p><lb n="071000"/>J. J. O'Molloy pulled a long face and walked on silently. They caught
